# DL-Cats_vs_Dogs_Classification

I have created a **[Convolutional Neural Network]()** for classifying Cats and dogs images.

I have created an **[GUI](https://github.com/Anuragtsl/DL-Cats_vs_Dogs_Classification/tree/main/GUI)** format for using the model.

I have used **[Google Colab]()** for coding!

***Follow the [juputer notebook](https://github.com/Anuragtsl/DL-Cats_vs_Dogs_Classification/blob/main/Cats_vs_Dogs_Classification.ipynb) for more!***

# The Asirra (Dogs VS Cats) dataset:

The Asirra (animal species image recognition for restricting access) dataset was introduced in 2013 for a machine learning competition. The dataset includes 25,000 images with equal numbers of labels for cats and dogs.

Download the **[dataset](https://github.com/Anuragtsl/DL-Cats_vs_Dogs_Classification/blob/main/Dataset.txt)** from here!
